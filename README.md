# Real-time-mask-detection
Machine learning utilizes the microcontroller and Yolov3 algorithm to identify specific objects.

The increase in the coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads significantly in the community, solutions are urgently needed to deal with the spread of infection.
Therefore, the establishment of a mask detection system is the best solution that can contribute to reducing the transmission rate of the COVID-19 virus. Increasing 
public awareness in maintaining health by using masks in public areas comprehensively which can prevent infection or prevent transmission of the virus to others. This thesis aims to develop a real-time identification system for people wearing masks that can be applied in public areas. Tests on the system are carried out to meet the requirements and 
ensure that system development can solve problems.
